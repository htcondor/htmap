v0.5.0
======

New Features
------------

* HTMap CLI commands that operate on tags can now pattern-match for tags using
  glob syntax.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/159
* Component status tracking should now be much faster once it has already been
  performed, since we now store some state between sessions.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/166
* :class:`htmap.Map`, :class:`htmap.MapStdOut`, :class:`htmap.MapStdErr`,
  and :class:`htmap.MapOutputFiles` now all support in the ``in`` operator to check
  if a component index is in the map.


Deprecated Features
-------------------

* The various iteration methods on :class:`htmap.Map` no longer have a
  ``callback`` argument.


Bug Fixes
---------

* It should now be much harder to accidentally get a dangling, inaccessible map
  due to an interrupted ``remove``.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/127
* When an execution errors occurs, the exception and traceback will be printed
  to stderr execute-side (in addition to being brought back submit-side).
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/178
* The CLI command ``htmap status --live`` now has much better behavior when
  the table width is nearly the width of the terminal.
* HTMap now handles late materialized jobs much more smoothly: maps with
  unmaterialized components can be removed and various CLI commands that output
  color won't fail when acting on maps with unmaterialized components. However,
  unmaterialized components do not show as `IDLE`, which mirrors the behavior
  of `condor_q`.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/158


Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
