v0.5.0
======

New Features
------------

* :class:`htmap.Map`, :class:`htmap.MapStdOut`, :class:`htmap.MapStdErr`,
  and :class:`htmap.MapOutputFiles` now all support in the ``in`` operator to check
  if a component index is in the map.


Deprecated Features
-------------------

* The various iteration methods on :class:`htmap.Map` no longer have a
  ``callback`` argument.


Bug Fixes
---------


Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
