======

New Features
------------

Bug Fixes

* Hopefully finally resolved a recurring issue with checkpoint directories being
  returned to the submit node after execution errors.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/128

Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
