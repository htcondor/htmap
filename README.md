# htmap

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/htmap/badge/?version=latest)](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


HTMap is a library that wraps the process of mapping Python function calls out to an HTCondor pool.
It provides tools for submitting, managing, and processing the output of arbitrary functions.

Our goal is to provide as transparent an interface as possible to high-throughput computing resources so that you can spend more time thinking about your own code, and less about how to get it running on a cluster.

For tutorials, installation instructions, and more details, see the [documentation](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
