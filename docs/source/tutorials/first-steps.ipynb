    "The second-easiest way is to run the tutorials in a Docker container on your computer.\n",

    "```\n",
    "docker run -p 8888:8888 htcondor/htmap-tutorials\n",
    "```\n",

    "This tutorial also assumes that you're working in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "It will work just as well in the Python REPL.\n",
    "Later, once you get a hang things, you'll be ready to use HTMap in scripts as well.\n",

    "If you click the \"View page source\" link in the upper right corner, you'll be able to grab the raw `.ipynb` file yourself and step through it along with the tutorial."
