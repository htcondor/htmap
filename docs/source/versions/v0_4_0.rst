v0.3.1
======

New Features
------------

* Acts and Edits on Maps that are not "active" (i.e., have components in the HTCondor queue)
  are now no-ops. Includes a new ``htmap.Map.is_active`` property, which is ``True`` if
  any components are still in the queue.

Bug Fixes
---------

Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
