HTMap is a library that wraps the process of mapping Python function calls out
to an HTCondor pool.
It provides tools for submitting, managing, and processing the output of
arbitrary functions.

Our goal is to provide as transparent an interface as possible to
high-throughput computing resources so that you can spend more time thinking
about your own code, and less about how to get it running on a cluster.

For tutorials, installation instructions, and more details, see the
[documentation](https://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Please post bug reports and feature requests to
[our issue tracker](https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues).
