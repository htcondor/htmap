    "It will work just as well in the Python REPL.\n",
    "Later, once you get a hang things, you'll be ready to use HTMap in scripts as well.\n",
    "Either way, you'll need to be on a computer that can see an HTCondor pool!\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you have already set up your dependency management, as described in [Dependency Management](../dependencies.rst).\n",
    "If your HTCondor pool supports Docker, you'll be good to go with the default settings.\n",

    "The tutorials in this series are written inside Juypter Notebooks.\n",
