v0.4.1
======

New Features
------------

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed a bug where maps submitted with late materialization would choke on the
  "cluster submit" event when reading their event log. Band-aided for now.

Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
