v0.4.0
======

New Features
------------

* **HTMap can now transfer output files!**
  See the new recipe: :doc:`/recipes/output-files` and the new :func:`htmap.transfer_output_files` function.
* HTMap's default Docker image is now ``htcondor/htmap-exec``, which is produced
  from a Dockerfile in the HTMap ``git`` repository. It is based on ``continuumio/anaconda3``,
  with ``htmap`` itself installed as well.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/152
* Redid :class:`htmap.Map` ``stdout`` and ``stderr``.
  They are now attributes that represent sequences over the ``stdout`` and ``stderr``
  from the map components, as strings, respectively.
* Acts and Edits on Maps that are not "active" (i.e., have components in the HTCondor queue)
  are now no-ops. Includes a new ``htmap.Map.is_active`` property, which is ``True`` if
  any components are still in the queue.

Bug Fixes
---------

Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
