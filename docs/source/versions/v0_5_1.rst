Deprecated Features

Bug Fixes
---------

* Maps can now be force-removed even if the schedd cannot be contacted.
  Graceful removal still requires contact with the schedd.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/186


Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
