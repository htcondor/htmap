v0.4.0
======

New Features
------------

* HTMap's default Docker image is now ``htcondor/htmap-exec``, which is produced
  from a Dockerfile in the HTMap ``git`` repository. It is based on ``continuumio/anaconda3``,
  with ``htmap`` itself installed as well.
  Issue: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/152

Bug Fixes
---------

Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
