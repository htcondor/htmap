class TransferPath:
    """
    A :class:`TransferPath` describes the location of a file or directory.
    If the ``protocol`` and ``location`` are both ``None``, it describes a
    location on the local filesystem. If either are given, it describes
    a remote location.

    When used as an argument to a mapped function, a :class:`TransferPath`
    tells HTMap to arrange for the specified files/directories to be transferred
    to the execute machine from some location, which may be the local filesystem
    on the submit machine or some remote location like an HTTP address or an
    S3 server.

    Transfer paths are recognized in mapped function inputs as long as they are
    either:

    #. Arguments or keyword arguments of the mapped function.
    #. Stored inside a primitive container (tuple, list, set, dictionary value)
       that is an argument or keyword argument of the mapped function. Nested
       containers are inspected recursively.

    When the mapped function runs execute-side, it will receive
    (instead of this object) a normal :class:`pathlib.Path` object pointing to
    the execute-side path of the file/directory.

    :class:`TransferPath` is also used to specify the locations for output files
    to be sent, if they are not to be returned to the submit machine.
    For example, output files could be sent to an S3 server.
    See the ``output_remaps`` argument of :class:`MapOptions` for more details
    on "remapped" output file transfer.

    Where appropriate, :class:`TransferPath` has the same interface as a
    :class:`pathlib.Path`. See the examples for some ways to leverage this API
    to efficiently construct transfer paths.

    .. attention::

        You may need to pass additional submit descriptors to your map
        to actually be able to use input/output transfers for certain protocols.
        For example, to transfer to and from an S3 server, you also need to pass
        ``aws_access_key_id_file`` and ``aws_secret_access_key_file``.
        See the
        `condor_submit documentation <https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man-pages/condor_submit.html>`_
        for more details.


    Examples
    --------

    Transfer a file stored in your home directory using HTCondor file transfer:

    .. code-block::

        transfer_path = htmap.TransferPath.cwd() / 'file.txt'

    Transfer a local file at an absolute path using HTCondor file transfer:

    .. code-block::

        transfer_path = htmap.TransferPath("/foo/bar/baz.txt")

    Get a file from an HTTP server, located at
    ``http://htmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/htmap-logo.svg``:

    .. code-block::

        transfer_path = htmap.TransferPath(
            path = "en/latest/_static/htmap-logo.svg",
            protocol = "http",
            location = "htmap.readthedocs.io",
        )

    or

    .. code-block::

        base_path = htmap.TransferPath(
            path = "/",
            protocol = "http",
            location = "htmap.readthedocs.io",
        )
