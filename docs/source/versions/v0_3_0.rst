v0.3.0
======

New Features
------------

* Revised internals on how error information is returned from execute nodes.
  HTMap now detects runtime errors during component status checks (without too much overhead).
* Add ``singularity`` delivery method.
* Add ``htmap components`` CLI command, which can print out individual component statuses for a map.
  For example, ``htmap components <tag>`` will print out all of the components for a map and their statuses.
  ``htmap components --status ERRORED <tag>`` will print out only the components whose status is ERRORED.
* Some execution errors (especially the kind that result in output not being produced)
  are now turned into holds by using the submit descriptor ``ON_EXIT_HOLD``.


Bug Fixes
---------


Known Issues
------------

* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree about the state of their components.
  This is a result of https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/129
