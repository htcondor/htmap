v0.6.0
======

New Features
------------

* Add the ``shared`` delivery method, which supports HTCondor pools that use
  shared filesystems to make Python installations available universally.
  Issues: https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/195
  and https://github.com/htcondor/htmap/issues/198
* The HTMap CLI now supports autocompletion on commands and tags.
  Run ``htmap autocompletion`` from the command line to add the necessary
  setup to your shell startup script.
* The HTMap CLI ``logs`` command now has a ``--view`` option which, instead of
  just printing the path to the HTMap log file, displays its contents.


Changed/Deprecated Features
---------------------------

* Several HTMap CLI commands now support explicit enable/disable flags instead
  of just one or other other. The default behaviors were not changed.


Bug Fixes
---------


Known Issues
------------

* Execution errors that result in the job being terminated but no output being
  produced are still not handled entirely gracefully. Right now, the component
  state will just show as ``ERRORED``, but there won't be an actual error report.
* Map component state may become corrupted when a map is manually vacated.
  Force-removal may be needed to clean up maps if HTCondor and HTMap disagree
  about the state of their components.
