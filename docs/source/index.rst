HTMap
======

.. py:currentmodule:: htmap

HTMap is a library that wraps the process of mapping Python function calls out to an `HTCondor pool`_.
It provides tools for submitting, managing, and processing the output of arbitrary functions.

.. _HTCondor pool: https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/

Our goal is to provide as transparent an interface as possible to
high-throughput computing resources so that you can spend more time thinking about your own code,
and less about how to get it running on a cluster.

Running a map over a Python function is as easy as

.. code-block:: python

    import htmap


    def double(x):
        return 2 * x


    doubled = list(htmap.map(double, range(10)))
    print(doubled)
    # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
